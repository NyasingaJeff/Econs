== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there any limits to customer counts in Jetpack CRM? =

There are absolutely no limits in Jetpack CRM, apart from the usual ones applied by your host (database size etc.)

= Can I develop on top of Jetpack CRM? =

Of course. Please reach out to us via the in-plugin feedback page if you want to, we'll help you get started, or check out our [Developer resources](https://jetpackcrm.com/feature/developer-ready/).

= Is Jetpack CRM really free? = 

Totally. The core is a solid, useful, Customer Relationship Manager right out of the box. You don't need anything else to get started managing your leads, and customers. We do build extensions, (because we need them), but they're not at all essential. Further, they're cheap in comparison to the pay-per-month CRM options.

= Where can I see the CRM extensions? = 

Here: https://jetpackcrm.com/extensions/

= Why host your own CRM in WordPress? = 

Data-privacy, control, extendibiliy. You're probably already paying for hosting too, so you'll save there. SaaS has its place, but there's so much value in hosting your own.

= How do I get my existing customers into Jetpack CRM? = 

The free core has a basic CSV Importer which works well. You can also use our extensions: CSV Importer, or one of the Sync's (PayPal Sync, Woo Sync, or Stripe Sync) - these automatically pull in all of your customer data (including transactions) and then keeps it up to date for you!

= Do you have a B2B mode? = 

Yep, that's an option in the settings. Enabling Business-to-Business mode adds a "Companies" layer, which lets you have contacts under a company.
